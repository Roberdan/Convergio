# Project Plan & Roadmap — Convergio

Objective
- Ship stable v1 with docs, CI quality signals, and repeatable deployment.

User Stories
- As a CEO, I want an executive dashboard so that I can monitor key metrics in real time.
- As a developer, I want reliable streaming events so that I can build responsive UIs.
- As a QA, I want coverage artifacts so that I can validate test completeness.

Backlog (RICE, indicative)
- Advanced Agent Management (CRUD) — Reach 40, Impact 7, Confidence 7, Effort 20 → RICE ≈ 9.8 (v2)
- Advanced Swarm Coordination — Reach 30, Impact 6, Confidence 6, Effort 15 → RICE ≈ 7.2 (v2)
- CEO Dashboard Supreme — Reach 25, Impact 7, Confidence 6, Effort 25 → RICE ≈ 4.2 (v3)
- Azure One‑Click Deployment — Reach 35, Impact 6, Confidence 6, Effort 18 → RICE ≈ 7.0 (v2)

Timeline (indicative)
- v1 (now): Docs, CI artifacts, stability.
- v2: Agent CRUD + advanced coordination + Azure deploy.
- v3: Supreme dashboard + predictive analytics.
