## Migration Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Incompatible Agents:**
   - Review `CommonValuesAndPrinciples.md` - No valid YAML frontmatter found

### Framework Compatibility

**Microsoft Agent Framework Requirements:**

- ✅ **ChatAgent Creation:**
  ```python
  agent = chat_client.create_agent(
      name=metadata.key,
      instructions=instructions,  # Full markdown content
      tools=tools  # List of @ai_function decorated functions
  )
  ```

- ✅ **Supported Elements:**
  - YAML frontmatter with name, description, tools, color
  - Markdown-formatted instructions/persona
  - Tool references as string array
  - Multi-turn conversations by default

- ❌ **NOT Supported (AutoGen-specific):**
  - `AssistantAgent`, `UserProxyAgent` classes
  - `llm_config` dictionaries
  - `GroupChat`, `GroupChatManager` classes
  - `FunctionTool` wrapper classes
  - `register_function` methods

## Conclusion

✅ **48/49 agents (98.0%) are already compatible** with Microsoft Agent Framework.

The agent definitions follow a clean, framework-agnostic structure that maps well to ChatAgent:
- YAML frontmatter provides metadata
- Markdown content serves as instructions
- Tool references are declarative

Minor updates needed for 1 agents to ensure full compatibility.
