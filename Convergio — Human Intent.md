# Convergio — Human Intent. AI Momentum.

## Problem
- Goals die in silos, handoffs, and tool sprawl; chat‑only LLMs aren’t reliable, governable, or cost‑aware.
- Execution excludes too many—especially people with disabilities—due to cognitive/physical load and non‑inclusive UX.

## Our stance (Agentic Manifesto)
- Intent is human, momentum is agent.
- Trust demands transparent provenance.
- Progress is outcomes, not output.
- We design from the edge first: disability, language, connectivity.

## Solution
A web AI Command Center that lets people and 40+ specialized AI agents collaborate seamlessly. From one chat: plan, execute, and measure with cost guardrails, security checks, and full observability. Human‑in‑the‑loop by default; inclusive interaction modes minimize cognitive/physical overhead.

## Business opportunity
- Measurable productivity gains, lower costs, fewer meetings, higher delivery reliability.
- Horizontal adoption (product/engineering/ops, services, regulated sectors) with SaaS + usage pricing.
- Extensible “agent marketplace” for domain packs and enterprise integrations.

## Near‑term impact → longer‑term mission
We start in core business execution (fast ROI, single control plane). Then we expand to accessible learning and school support—so students like Mario can direct complex work, learn with mentor agents, and participate fully and safely.

## One‑liner
Convergio turns goals into outcomes by pairing people and AI agents—faster, cheaper, more inclusive.
